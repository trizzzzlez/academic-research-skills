一套完整的學術研究 Claude Code 技能包，涵蓋從研究到論文出版的全流程。

A comprehensive suite of Claude Code skills for academic research, covering the full pipeline from research to publication.

---

## Features

- **Deep Research** — 10-agent research team with Socratic guided mode
- **Academic Paper** — 10-agent paper writing with chapter-by-chapter planning
- **Academic Paper Reviewer** — Multi-perspective peer review (Editor-in-Chief + 3 dynamic reviewers)
- **Academic Pipeline** — Full pipeline orchestrator coordinating all skills

### Full Pipeline

```
Research (socratic/full) → Write (plan/full) → Review (full/guided) → Revise → Finalize
```

---

## Prerequisites

### Install Node.js

Claude Code requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install node

# Windows (using winget)
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS

# Linux (using nvm)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install --lts
```

### Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Set Up API Key

You need an Anthropic API key. Get one at https://console.anthropic.com/

```bash
# Claude Code will prompt for your API key on first run
claude
```

Or set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx
```

---

## Installation

### Method 1: As Project Skills (Recommended)

Clone this repo into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create skills directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .claude/skills

# Clone the skills
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/academic-research-skills.git .claude/skills/academic-research-skills
```

Then copy the `.claude/CLAUDE.md` content into your project's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (merge with existing if you have one).

### Method 2: As a Standalone Project

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/academic-research-skills.git

# Navigate to the project
cd academic-research-skills

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

### Method 3: Upload to claude.ai

1. Download each skill's `SKILL.md` file
2. Go to claude.ai → Project → Project Knowledge
3. Upload the SKILL.md files

> **Note**: claude.ai upload only supports individual files. The full multi-agent experience works best with Claude Code.

## Usage

### Quick Start

```
# Start a full research pipeline
You: "我想做一篇關於 AI 對高教品保影響的研究論文"

# Start with Socratic guidance
You: "引導我研究 AI 在教育評鑑中的應用"

# Write a paper with guided planning
You: "引導我寫一篇關於少子化影響的論文"

# Review an existing paper
You: "幫我審查這篇論文" (then provide the paper)

# Check pipeline status
You: "進度" or "status"
```
